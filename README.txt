1. file1.txt and file2.txt are the input file for pnpscalc.py and finding_mutation_coordinates
2. file3.txt is the output of finding_mutation_coordinates
3. file3.txt is the input for polarityfinder.py
4. codon-aminoacid.csv is the input file for polarityfinder.py that has the information for all the codon & amino-acids

These set of three programs calculates the mutation in two sequences, finds the co-ordinates and and change in the polarity of the amino-acid due to mutation
